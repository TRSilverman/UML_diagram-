This is a UML model of a ski resort at a very basic overview. 

Once the requirement for snow is met a ski resort can be broken down into the employee side (structural) and 
customer side (behavior). The staff creates the skiable area by grooming runs, setting boundaries, and running 
the hotels.

The customer stays in the hotels, follows the groomed runs, uses the ski lifts, and is then able to ski themselves.
